# dynamicRekEpsilom Turbulence Model
An improved k-epsilon turbulence model applied to incompressible round jets.
The main advantage of the proposed model is its dependence on a single input parameter - the Reynolds number which is based on the nozzle exit diameter. Other coefficients are determined as a function of the Reynolds number.
